/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * A templateConstraint contains an expression which must have an effective baseType of boolean and single cardinality.
 * For more information about the runtime data model employed see Expressions. If the expression is false (including if
 * the expression is NULL), the template variables are set to their default values and templateProcessing is restarted;
 * this happens repeatedly until the expression is true or the maximum number of iterations is reached. In the event
 * that the maximum number of iterations is reached, any default values provided for the variables during declaration
 * are used. Processing then continues with the next templateRule after the templateConstraint, or finishes if
 * there are no further templateRules.
 *
 * By using a templateConstraint, authors can ensure that the values of variables set during templateProcessing satisfy
 * the condition specified by the boolean expression. For example, two randomly selected numbers might be required
 * which have no common factors.
 *
 * A templateConstraint may occur anywhere as a child of templateProcessing. It may not be used as a child of any other
 * element. Any number of templateConstraints may be used, though two or more consecutive templateConstraints could
 * be combined using the 'and' element to combine their boolean expressions.
 *
 * The maximum number of times that the operations preceding the templateConstraint can be expected to be performed
 * is assumed to be 100; implementations may permit more iterations, but there must be a finite maximum number of
 * iterations. This prevents the occurrence of an endless loop. It is the responsibility of the author to provide
 * default values for any variables assigned under a templateConstraint.
