 * The DivideProcessor class aims at processing Divide operators.

 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The divide operator takes 2 sub-expressions which both have single cardinality and
 * numerical base-types. The result is a single float that corresponds to the first
 * expression divided by the second expression. If either of the sub-expressions is
 * NULL then the operator results in NULL.
 *
 * Item authors should make every effort to ensure that the value of the second
 * expression is never 0, however, if it is zero or the resulting value is outside
 * the value set defined by float (not including positive and negative infinity) then
 * the operator should result in NULL.
