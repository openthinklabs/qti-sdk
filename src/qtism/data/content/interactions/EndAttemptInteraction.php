 * The end attempt interaction is a special type of interaction which allows
 * item authors to provide the candidate with control over the way in which
 * the candidate terminates an attempt. The candidate can use the interaction
 * to terminate the attempt (triggering response processing) immediately,
 * typically to request a hint. It must be bound to a response variable
 * with base-type boolean and single cardinality.
 *
 * If the candidate invokes response processing using an endAttemptInteraction
 * then the associated response variable is set to true. If response processing
 * is invoked in any other way, either through a different endAttemptInteraction
 * or through the default method for the delivery engine, then the associated
 * response variable is set to false. The default value of the response variable
