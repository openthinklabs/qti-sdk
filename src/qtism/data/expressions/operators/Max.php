 * The max operator takes 1 or more sub-expressions which all have numerical
 * base-types and may have single, multiple or ordered cardinality. The result
 * is a single float, or, if all sub-expressions are of integer type, a single
 * integer, equal in value to the greatest of the argument values, i.e. the
 * result is the argument closest to positive infinity. If the arguments have
 * the same value, the result is that same value. If any of the sub-expressions
 * is NULL, the result is NULL. If any of the sub-expressions is not a numerical
 * value, then the result is NULL.
