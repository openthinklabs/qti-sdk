/**
 * From IMS QTI:
 *
 * The member operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have the same base-type.
 * The first sub-expression must have single cardinality and the second must be a
 * multiple or ordered container. The result is a single boolean with a value
 * of true if the value given by the first sub-expression is in the container
 * defined by the second sub-expression. If either sub-expression is NULL then
 * the result of the operator is NULL.
 *
 * The member operator should not be used on sub-expressions with a base-type
 * of float because of the poorly defined comparison of values. It must not
 * be used on sub-expressions with a base-type of duration.
